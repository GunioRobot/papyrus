Renderers

- add integration test to make sure that the geojson renderer works for views
  (with add_view and/or view_config)

Protocol

- find a way to determine the geom attribute's srid, and simplify the Protocol signature
- test CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE (and correct the documentation)
- the _get_order_by function is incorrect - looking at __table__.c[column_name] isn't right

Testing

- use nose and coverage (see Pyramid narrative doc)
